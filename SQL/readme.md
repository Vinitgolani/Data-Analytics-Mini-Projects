## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the Repository

This repository is designed to guide you through practical SQL-based projects. It contains both tutorial codes and mini-projects, focusing on analyzing large datasets and deriving actionable insights. Each project illustrates how to use SQL for strategic decision-making.

### 2.1 SQL Tutorial Codes

The tutorial codes in this repository will walk you through the basics of SQL, from simple `SELECT` queries to more complex data manipulations. You'll find step-by-step instructions on how to build queries that extract meaningful insights from datasets.

### 2.2 SQL Mini Projects 

One of the key projects in this repository involves analyzing global layoffs data. The project demonstrates various SQL techniques used to clean the data and extract useful trends, insights, and rolling totals for strategic decision-making.

In this project, I performed multiple types of analyses:
- **Basic Queries**: Initial data exploration to understand the structure and size of the layoffs dataset.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends in the layoffs data, such as the companies and industries with the highest layoffs, as well as the percentage of employees laid off by different companies.
- **Rolling Totals**: Using SQL to calculate rolling totals of layoffs per month, allowing us to observe the cumulative layoffs over time.
- **Aggregated Insights**: Grouping data by various factors like company, industry, location, and year, to gain a broader understanding of the patterns and correlations in the layoffs data.

These analyses reveal critical insights into which companies were most affected, which regions experienced the highest layoffs, and the industries where layoffs were most prevalent.

## üéØ Why This Matters

This project showcases my proficiency in SQL and its application to real-world datasets, particularly in the context of business and economic analysis. By working on this project, I have demonstrated the ability to:

- **Clean and Analyze Data**: Use SQL to clean and prepare data for analysis, ensuring the dataset is structured and ready for deeper insights.
- **Extract Insights for Decision-Making**: Perform in-depth analysis and provide meaningful insights that can inform strategic decisions, such as identifying trends, areas of concern, and potential opportunities.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Implement more complex SQL techniques such as `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `CTEs`, and window functions to perform sophisticated analysis and generate detailed reports.

These skills are vital for any data analyst working in the industry today. SQL is widely used for managing and analyzing large datasets, and this project demonstrates my readiness to apply these skills to real-world business problems.

Working on this project has also equipped me with the practical knowledge to:
- Handle large datasets and ensure data integrity.
- Perform trend analysis and derive actionable insights.
- Prepare reports that support strategic decision-making processes.

In conclusion, this project showcases my readiness to work on industrial data analytics projects, and I‚Äôm confident that my SQL skills can be applied to solve complex business challenges.
